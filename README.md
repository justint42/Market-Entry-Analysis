# CitiBike Challenge 

## Overview 

### Purpose 

One of the key ingredients of experiencing (or simply dealing with) the urban sprawl is the ability to traverse it. Sometimes, conventional public transportation simply does not make the cut for some people. This is true for moany New York Ciy residents. "CitiBike", an established faux bike-rental company based in NYC wishes to expand to Des Moines, Iowa. 

To justify the seed funding to explore a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, we must identify the differing mechanics in how this would operate in this new city. For this analysis, I showed count of checked bikes for all NYC riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. 

This project represents the beginning stages (the 
"NYC Stage" of this business venture.

Manhattan's sprawling urban landscape and density allows for a healthy means for bike travel. What do the most popular districts in this area have in common with Des Moines?

Five minutes is the most common average time for bike-sharing. Consumers mostly use us for short-term travel. Time tapers off at around the 20 minute mark.

Most persisting costomers tend to also be subscribers. 

## Summary

From the data, we can surmise that users use the service during the mornings and evening rush hours. CitiBike services are an ideal alternative to public transportation during weekdays and for leisure during the weekend. What are the parallels between NYC and Des Moines?

CitiBike can gain further insight by creating visualizations for different months to find trends across the entire year. Another suggestion would be to find ride data among other cities more like Des Moines (lower population, urban density).
